## Another music player

This project came forth out of my own experimentation with web technologies. It contains many flaws and bugs that I'm still trying to work out.

If you want to get it to work you'll have to add a file called `track.mp3`. Other file formats will probably work fine because of the web player integration but they haven't been tested.
